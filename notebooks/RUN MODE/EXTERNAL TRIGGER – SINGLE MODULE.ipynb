In this different channels of the proteus module will get triggered from external signal generator source frequency.This script test for both triggers defined TRG1 and TRG2. This test will run for multiple sampling rate from 1GHz to 2.5GHz for all channels and from 2.5GHz to 9GHz for Channel 1 & 3 only.\n",
