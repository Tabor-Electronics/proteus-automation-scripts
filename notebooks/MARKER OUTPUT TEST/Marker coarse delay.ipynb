    "### Test Description:\n",
    "In this script there will be certain iterations for sampling rate (1.25,2.5 and 9 GSA/s) and for each channel, total 2 tests will run one for positive delay and other for negative delay, we are providing the coarse delay of 28,-28, 32,-32 and 128,-128  points/cycles for respective sampling rates.\n",
    "The script will also modify according to the sampling rate, for sampling rate below 2.5GSas there will be 4 channels each having 2 markers, and above 2.5 Gsas we have 2 channels with 4 markers each.\n",
